# Debug Stick

This add-on is a port of the infamous Debug Stick item that was
exclusive to Minecraft: Java Edition.

[**Skip to the download page**][curseforge-dl]

Ever wish Bedrock had Java's debug stick? Yeah, me too &mdash; so I made one.

This add-on lets you mess with the "block properties" in-game, just like the
Java-exclusive debug stick item. Tap blocks to change their states. Long-press
to choose what you wanna change. Sneak and tap to get detailed info.

## ✨ What Can You Do?

- **Tap blocks** to cycle through their states (e.g., waterlog chests, lit
  or unlit furnaces, make ladders stick on air, etc.)
- **Long-press** to choose what you wanna change (e.g., direction of the
  block, type of wood, etc.)
- **Sneak + tap** to show detailed info about a block (more on that below!)
- **Actionbar messages** help you figure out what you're changing!

## 🔍 Block Viewer (Bonus Feature!)

This is a Bedrock-only thing I've added! Just sneak and tap a block to get all
kinds of info you may need:

- **Block ID** (i.e., `minecraft:log`)
- **Location** (`0 1 2`)
- **Matter state** (solid, liquid, gas)
- **Redstone power** (amount of redstone, 0-15)
- **Hard block** (passable by arrows?)
- **Property states** (`pillar_axis`, `waterlogged`, etc.)
- **Tags** (`#wood`, `#log`, etc.)

Very useful for mapmakers, redstoners, or just curious players!

*(This feature requires Minecraft Bedrock 1.20.60 or higher)*
