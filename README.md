# Debug Stick

This add-on implements a debug stick based on Minecraft: Java Edition.

</div>

> [*Now available on MCPEDL!*](https://mcpedl.com/debug-stick/)

### Features

Similar to Java Edition, you can:

- Modify block properties
- Update property values
- View messages on the action bar
- Block viewer (as of 1.6.0, mc 1.20.60)

This add-on has been tested and functions correctly with Minecraft: Bedrock
Edition 1.20.0 and above.

## How to Obtain

- Download the add-on from the [releases section][releases] or directly [here][dl].

- Enable Experimental Beta APIs and Holiday Creator Features.
- Open your world.
- Enter the following command in the chat:

    ```text

Starting from version 1.2.0 (mc 1.20.30), the Holiday Creator Features
experimental toggle is no longer required.

### Limitations

- Some block properties from Minecraft Java Edition are not accessible.
