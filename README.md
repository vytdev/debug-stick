# Debug Stick

This add-on is a port of the infamous Debug Stick item, that was
exclusive from Minecraft: Java Edition.

Ever wish Bedrock had Java's debug stick? Yeah, me too &mdash; so I made one.

This add-on lets you mess with the "block properties" in-game, just like the
Java-exclusive debug stick item. Tap blocks to change their states. Long-press
to choose what you wanna change. Sneak and tap to get detailed info.

### ‚ú® What You Can Do?

- Tap blocks to cycle through their states (e.g., waterlog chests, lit or
  unlit furnaces, make ladders stick on air, etc.)
- Long press to choose what you wanna change (e.g., direction of the block,
  type of wood, etc.)
- Action bar msgs help you figure out what you're changing!
- Sneak + tap = show detailed infos about a block (more on that below!)

### üîç Block Viewer (Bonus Feature!)

This is a Bedrock-only thing I've added! Just sneak and tap a block to get all
kinds of infos you may need:

- **Block ID** (i.e., `minecraft:log`)
- **Location** (`0 1 2`)
- **Matter state** (solid, liquid, gas)
- **Redstone power** (amount of redstone, 0-15)
- **Hard block** (passable by arrows?)
- **Property states** (`pillar_axis`, `waterlogged`, etc.)
- **Tags** (`#wood`, `#log`, etc.)

Very useful to mapmakers, redstoners, or just curious players!

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires Minecraft Bedrock 1.20.60 or higher
