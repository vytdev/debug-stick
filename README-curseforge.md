# Debug Stick

This add-on is a port of the infamous Debug Stick item, that was
exclusive from Minecraft: Java Edition.

Ever wish Bedrock had Java's debug stick? Yeah, me too &mdash; so I made one.

This add-on lets you mess with the "block properties" in-game, just like the
Java-exclusive debug stick item. Tap blocks to change their states. Long-press
to choose what you wanna change. Sneak and tap to get detailed info.

## ‚ú® What You Can Do?

- Tap blocks to cycle through their states (e.g., waterlog chests, lit or
  unlit furnaces, make ladders stick on air, etc.)
- Long press to choose what you wanna change (e.g., direction of the block,
  type of wood, etc.)
- Action bar msgs help you figure out what you're changing!
- Sneak + tap = show detailed infos about a block (more on that below!)

## üîç Block Viewer (Bonus Feature!)

![Block Viewer Image][img-blk-viewer]

This is a Bedrock-only thing I've added! Just sneak and tap a block to get all
kinds of infos you may need:

- **Block ID** (i.e., `minecraft:log`)
- **Location** (`0 1 2`)
- **Matter state** (solid, liquid, gas)
- **Redstone power** (amount of redstone, 0-15)
- **Hard block** (passable by arrows?)
- **Property states** (`pillar_axis`, `waterlogged`, etc.)
- **Tags** (`#wood`, `#log`, etc.)

Very useful to mapmakers, redstoners, or just curious players!

*(This feature requires Minecraft Bedrock 1.20.60 or higher)*

## üéÅ How To Get It?

1. Download the add-on for your Minecraft version.
2. Import the add-on to Minecraft.
3. Activate it in your world.
4. If your Minecraft version is *lower than 1.20.30*, enable
   `Holiday Creator Features` experiment.
5. If your Minecraft version is *lower than 1.21.70*, enable
   `Beta APIs` experiment.
6. Load up your world!
7. Type `/give @s vyt:debug_stick`, or check the Creative menu.
8. That's it!

## üìÇ Where to Download?

You can get the add-on from **CurseForge (recommended)** or
**GitHub**. Please try the Linkvertise links to support me &mdash;
it really helps! But if those don‚Äôt work for you, you can use the
backup links instead.

- [Linkvertise ‚Üí CurseForge][lnk-curseforge-dl]
- [Linkvertise ‚Üí GitHub][lnk-github-dl]
- [Backup ‚Üí CurseForge][dir-curseforge-dl]
- [Backup ‚Üí GitHub][dir-github-dl]

**CurseForge is best** because it helps you find the right version
of the add-on for your Minecraft Bedrock version. Use GitHub only
if CurseForge doesn't work for you. Just find your version there
and download the `.mcpack` or `.zip` file.

You can also download it from MCPEDL, but it might be harder to
get the right version.
